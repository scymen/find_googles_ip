### `Abandoned`

`Try another way to get through the WALL like using a VPN or a PROXY.`
`(e.g: shadowsocks â€¦)`





A useful tool to find out the survived IP of google in TIANCHAO.

Google was blocked randomly and DNS Poisoning by the GFW of TIANCHAO since
many years ago, and it's getting worse now. It's very difficult to visit
google website inside the WALL. Fortunately, not all of the IPs were in the
black list of THE GREAT FIRE WALL. With shattered hopes, we try to find out
the IP which is survived if we're lucky enough.




It works well with `Windows`, `Debian` and `MAC`.
